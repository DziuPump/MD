# LLM-Based Test Case Generation and Evaluation

This repository contains research data and examples used in my master's thesis, which explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate and evaluate software test cases from system requirements.

# Data Directory

Each dataset entry contains:
- **X** → The *input*: a system requirement (non-functional)
- **y** → The *output*: test cases and evaluation metrics generated by multiple LLMs
