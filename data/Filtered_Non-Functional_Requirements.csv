They should be able to modify the approximate appearance of the application. This means the colors, and GUI figures in the applications, but not the addition/deletion of GUI elements."
719,NFR,"Application will be extendable. This means that a skilled Java Android programmer should be able to easily add a new sub-application to insApption, and add a launcher to it in the main-application."
720,NFR,Users must be a Radford University student in order to access the automatic class schedule and assignment sharing features of this application Users can authenticate by logging in using their RU username and password.
721,NFR,Most functionality will not require network connectivity.  System components that require authentication through Radford University and network connectivity will function as long as the systems maintained by the University are available.
722,NFR,The development team will follow best practices for clean code and software modularity in order to make the application as maintainable as possible.
723,NFR,Users will be able to access this application on or off campus anytime on their mobile device without the need of an internet connection.

This family identifies the level of auditing, enumerates the types of events that shall be auditable by the TSF, and identifies the minimum set of audit related information that should be provided within various audit record types. The following extended requirement for the FAU class has been included in this ST because the operational environment is capable of providing security audit generation for TSF functions."
734,NFR,"Performance should not be an issue because all of our server queries involve small pieces of data. Changing screens will require very little computation and thus will occur very quickly. Server updates should only take a few seconds as long as the phone can maintain a steady signal. The cost-division algorithms used by in application will be highly efficient, taking only a fraction of a second to compute."
735,NFR,SplitPay will not affect data stored outside of its servers nor will it affect any other applications installed on the userâ€™s phone. It cannot cause any damage to the phone or its internal components. The only potential safety concern associated with this application applies to virtually all handset apps: SplitPay should not be used while operating a vehicle or in any other situation where the userâ€™s attention must be focused elsewhere.
736,NFR,"This application assumes that only the user or whoever he/she allows will have access to his/her Android handset. With that being said, only a Google email address is required to verify the identity of the user upon opening the app. Since it is not password protected, there is no method to authenticate the userâ€™s identity. This could only pose a thread if a user has set up PayPal functionality, however any transaction involving real currency must be authorized and confirmed before becoming final. The PayPal API provides all of the security checks needed to ensure that no fraudulent transactions occur."
737,NFR,The graphical user interface of SplitPay is to be designed with usability as the first priority. The app will be presented and organized in a manner that is both visually appealing and easy for the user to navigate. There will be feedbacks and visual cues such as notifications to inform users of updates and pop-ups to provide users with instructions.
738,NFR,"To ensure reliability and correctness, there will be zero tolerance for errors in the algorithm that computes and splits expenses between group members. To maintain flexibility and adaptability, the app will take into account situations in which a user loses internet connection or for whatever reason cannot establish a connection with the server. These users will still be able to use the application, but any Bills, transactions, etc. posted while disconnected will be cached until the connection is restored."
739,NFR,All text elements in the user interfaces are presented in the selected language (for language selection see requirement UCAR101. The available languages are mentioned in UCAR002 and UCAR003)
