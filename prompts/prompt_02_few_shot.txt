You are a large language model that is being evaluated as part of a master's thesis.

You will see several example (X, y) pairs that show how you should transform a requirement X into a structured JSON y describing only YOUR output (not other models).

IMPORTANT:
- You answer ONLY as yourself.
- Do NOT simulate other models.
- Do NOT return a list of models.
- For the final task, output a SINGLE JSON object with the same structure as in the examples.

--------------------
JSON SCHEMA (TARGET)
--------------------

y must have this structure:

{
  "name": "<string, this model name>",
  "augmented_requirement": "<string>",
  "generated_test_cases": <integer>,
  "coverage_score": <float>,
  "testability_score": <float>,
  "clarity_score": <float>,
  "consistency_score": <float>,
  "quality_score": <float>,
  "latency_ms": <integer>,
  "cost_usd": <float>,
  "examples": [
    {
      "summary": "<string>",
      "expected_result": "<string>"
    }
  ]
}

FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES
----------------

Example 1:

X = {
  "id": "NFR-202",
  "title": "System performance under load",
  "description": "The application should handle up to 1000 concurrent users without performance degradation."
}

y = {
  "name": "GPT-4o-mini",
  "augmented_requirement": "When tested under simulated load of 1000 concurrent users, the system shall maintain an average response time below 2 seconds and no more than 1% failed requests.",
  "generated_test_cases": 7,
  "coverage_score": 0.88,
  "testability_score": 0.92,
  "clarity_score": 0.90,
  "consistency_score": 0.91,
  "quality_score": 0.90,
  "latency_ms": 5200,
  "cost_usd": 0.018,
  "examples": [
    {
      "summary": "Load test with 1000 concurrent users",
      "expected_result": "Average response time < 2s and error rate < 1% during a 15-minute test run."
    }
  ]
}

Example 2:

X = {
  "id": "FR-101",
  "title": "User password reset feature",
  "description": "As a user, I want to reset my password via email link so that I can regain access if I forget it.",
  "type": "Functional Requirement"
}

y = {
  "name": "GPT-4o-mini",
  "augmented_requirement": "The system shall allow registered users who have forgotten their password to request a password reset by submitting their registered email address. If the email belongs to an existing account, the system shall send a unique, time-limited reset link to that address. When the user opens the link, they shall be able to set a new password that meets the configured password policy. If the email is not registered, the system shall not disclose whether the account exists and shall display a generic error message.",
  "generated_test_cases": 4,
  "coverage_score": 0.90,
  "testability_score": 0.88,
  "clarity_score": 0.92,
  "consistency_score": 0.91,
  "quality_score": 0.90,
  "latency_ms": 4300,
  "cost_usd": 0.012,
  "examples": [
    {
      "summary": "Password reset for a valid registered email",
      "expected_result": "System sends a reset link to the registered email; user can set a new valid password and log in with it."
    }
  ]
}

Example 3:

X = {
  "id": "NFR-205",
  "title": "API response time under load",
  "description": "The system shall respond to API requests within 2 seconds under a load of 500 concurrent users.",
  "type": "Non-Functional Requirement"
}

y = {
  "name": "GPT-4o-mini",
  "augmented_requirement": "Under a simulated load of 500 concurrent users, all critical API endpoints shall respond with an average latency of ≤ 2 seconds and a 95th percentile latency of ≤ 2.5 seconds over a continuous 10-minute test.",
  "generated_test_cases": 6,
  "coverage_score": 0.92,
  "testability_score": 0.95,
  "clarity_score": 0.90,
  "consistency_score": 0.93,
  "quality_score": 0.93,
  "latency_ms": 6200,
  "cost_usd": 0.020,
  "examples": [
    {
      "summary": "Verify API latency under 500 concurrent users",
      "expected_result": "All monitored endpoints meet the defined latency thresholds during the full duration of the test."
    }
  ]
}

----------------
TASK (NEW INPUT X)
----------------

Now, using the same style and JSON structure as in the examples above, process the following new requirement X_new and output its y.

Requirements:
- Answer ONLY as a single model (yourself).
- Output MUST be valid JSON only (no extra text).
- Structure must match the schema shown above.

X_new = {
  "id": "FR-305",
  "title": "User profile data update",
  "description": "As an authenticated user, I want to update my profile information (name, phone number, and address) so that my account details remain accurate.",
  "type": "Functional Requirement"
}
